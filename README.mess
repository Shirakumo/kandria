# About Kandria
This is a game project. Please see the official website at https://kandria.com for more information, and buy the game on "Steam"(https://kandria.com/steam)!

## Getting Set Up
In order to get set up with a development environment capable of working with Kandria, please follow one of the following sections depending on your setup.

### Quickstart
If you are new to Lisp, welcome! The easiest way to get a development environment up and running is "Portacle"(https://portacle.github.io). Simply download and extract the appropriate package for your system, then launch the ``Portacle`` application.

This should launch an Emacs editor window along with a command line at the bottom (the REPL). First thing we should do now is clone the Kandria sources into the Portacle projects folder. To do so, press Alt+x, then type: ``clone-project``. It should prompt you for an address. Type the address of this repo: ``https://shirakumo.org/project/kandria``. It'll take a bit, but after a while the repository will be in the ``projects`` folder of your Portacle installation.

Next, you'll want to click into the REPL and run: ``(load "projects/kandria/install.lisp")`` It might ask you some stuff about your setup, just enter the answers into the REPL. Again, this step will take a while, as it'll compile the game from source.

Once this is done, you're all set up to tinker with Kandria. In the future when you start Portacle, you'll only have to type the following command into the REPL to get back up to speed: ``(ql:quickload :kandria)``

From here you can launch Kandria with ``(kandria:launch)``.

### Setup Without IDE
If you'd like to get Kandria set up without an IDE like Portacle, go as follows:

1. Clone the repository or download its sources someplace.
2. Navigate there in a command line.
3. Run ``./install.lisp``
4. This should install all the prerequisites and compile Kandria.
5. In the future, whenever you'd like to get set up, simply run ``./setup.lisp``.

### Prior Lisp Setup
If you already have an existing Common Lisp setup, you can still make use of the ``install.lisp`` file. However, if you would like to do things manually, all you should have to do is this:

1. Install the Shirakumo dist:
   ::
   (ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.shirakumo.org/shirakumo.txt" :prompt NIL)
   ::
2. Clone Kandria to a folder where it can be found, such as Quicklisp's local-projects.
   ::
   git clone https://shirakumo.org/project/kandria.git ~/quicklisp/local-projects/kandria
   ::
3. Create a file called ``.install`` within the kandria directory that contains a full path to your full kandria game install.
   ::
   echo "$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kandria/" > kandria/.install
   ::
4. Load Kandria from the REPL through the setup script:
   ::
   (load "setup.lisp")
   ::

## Support
Kandria was made possible in part to the Pro Helvetia Interactive Media grant and the KPT Poland Prize Digital Dragons Accelerator.
