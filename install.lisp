#| How to:
# First, install SBCL by whatever means you can. On Linux, this is
# usually via your package manager. On Windows you'll need an installer
# from sbcl.org.
# 
# Next, run this script. From a Unix shell, you should be able to just
# run ./install.lisp . If you are using a Windows command prompt,
# instead ensure SBCL is in your PATH, and perform the following line
# on your own.

exec sbcl --dynamic-space-size 4GB --noinform --no-sysinit --no-userinit --load "$0" --quit

# The script will set up Quicklisp inside the Kandria distribution and
# also install any other prerequisite libraries.
|#
