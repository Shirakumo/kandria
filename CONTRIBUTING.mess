## Contribution Scope
This repository is for the core Kandria content. Please do not submit things such as:

- New mechanics

- Generally any kind of additional game content
- Large changes to the game's visuals

If you are interested in adding these kinds of changes, please create a mod instead. Things that should be submitted to this repository:

- Bug fixes
- Spelling/grammar fixes in the translations
- Performance optimisations
- Documentation improvements
- etc.

## Contribution Pipeline
The process for contributing goes roughly as follows:

1. You clone the repository and create the changes.
2. You add an entry to the "changelog"(link CHANGES.mess) with your name and a description of what you changed.
3. You submit a Pull Request for the change.
4. A maintainer will look at your changes and review them.
   1. If there are any outstanding issues with your code, they will be discussed.
   2. You may have to go back and amend some changes, for your contribution to fit into the style and scope of the project.
   3. This repeats until your changes are considered ready to merge.
5. The changes are merged into the master branch of the repository and officially accepted.
6. A new game build is uploaded to storefronts such as Steam such that players can profit.
   Note that this is a manual process and it may take some days before we get to it.

If you are unsure whether your contribution would be accepted or not, please file an Issue ticket first, and we will discuss your proposal.
