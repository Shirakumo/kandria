Combat models are equipped with a standard Artemis EStuB and are trained to execute a variety of directional attack moves in two types: light and heavy.

Heavy moves trade an increase in power for slower wind up and tail end execution speed. Both types can be performed in different directions, both in the air and on the ground. Both types can also be charged for a stronger variant.

Finally, models are also equipped with evasion and countering routines. Executing a dash during combat will chain into an evade, which can be followed by a punishing counter move of either type."

ROBOTS AUTHORIZED TO [unreadable]

[unreadable - Jacen?] Barrera, AI correspondent

Semi recently actioned the [unreadable] that permits robots from their top-tier service line (more commonly known as [unreadable - \"Servos\", I expect]) to self-identify by choosing a name.

It is expected they will [unreadable] assign themselves a random name (or \"string\") using a pre-programmed name generator, which is claimed to realistically generate names from a diverse [unreadable] of cultures and ethnicities. This would replace their existing name, which is typically a phonetic contraction of their serial number. But AI activists are concerned this may spark a new era of human-AI relations, with fears continuing to grow over so-called \"AI [unreadable].\"

Speaking from her office at Semi headquarters in Boston, MA, Chief Marketing Officer Adrienne Carson-Miln was keen to clarify the move: \"This is indeed an opportunity to enhance consumer accessibility, so that robots feel like a part of the family.\" She added: \"Of course we want to improve relations with our smart AI companions. But sentience is impossible, and a very different thing to sapience. People should read a dictionary once in a while.\"

[The rest of the article is missing, as are the details of the publication, and the lower half of the photo and its caption: it's just a Servo's face looking at the camera. But the inflammatory journalistic style is practically a trademark of the Zenith Zodiac.]"

It's hard to know if having these thoughts is normal. I feel like if I told my [unreadable] they'd call the police. I don't think your [sic] meant to visualize stabbing random [unreadable] with a six-foot sword. Am I a closet killer? I can't stop thinking that I might be.

Its [sic] getting worse though, these last couple of years. And the times I think I might have hurt someone (never with a sword) the more I just don't want to go out any more. Nothing makes you feel crazy like a 45-minute walk home from work in the hot sun, worrying if you checked the reception door was locked - what if it didn't close properly, then someone got in and stabbed M? That'd be on me. And then I walk aaaaaall the way back to check - and finally get home gone 7! I need to be more present, stop thinking about [unreadable] and instead actually remember what I'm doing. Unless my memory is failing like [unreadable]. It's exhausting and I feel like I'm gonna EXPLODE.

H knows - I had to say something when she found me stood bolt upright staring into the corner. Fuck was I embarassed [sic], it hurts to think about. Things you do when you think no one's looking. She said it sounds like OCD, or \"the doubting disease\" - and that compulsions make obsessions worse. How's she now [sic] so much? I thought OCD was just hygiene obsession. I did some [unreadable] online and I think she might be right though. How'd I miss this? I need to look at it more, but it would be good to put a name to all this bullshit. I think I've had this my whole life, but now it's getting worse - probably cuz the world is getting worse. Or maybe it just feels like that the older you get? What would the treatment be? If there's a cure then how many things might I have done different without getting stuck my whole life.

I've set a [unreadable] to book a Root doc in the morning. If I can even get a [unreadable] appointment now. Isn't it emergencies only, even with androids?

Eventually his presence became not only expected, but a natural fact of life.

Unfortunately, his reign would not last. By the early days of his seventh month, his creators had finished his replacement, and he was buried, both literally and figuratively. His successor was superior in every way, but that meant little to the cylinder, because he was made of plastic.

But after fifteen minutes of explanation she'd only covered a third of the rules; then they'd remembered they needed to go help in the kitchen, or that they'd agreed to look at Nana's holiday photos - or said it was getting a bit late but they'd surely play next time. And so next visit they said they'd give it a try, but as she laid out the board again, they drifted off and started watching a movie on TV instead, or got into an argument.

But next time; next time for sure.
