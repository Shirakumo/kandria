; NARRATIVE: the saboteur has been destroying the cameras in ways to avoid arousing suspicion, so they seem like electrical fires, poor maintenance, etc. However, by the fourth one, once the sabotage is clearly known, it recasts these descriptions of damage as likely sabotage.

~ innis
| (:angry)You! How did you reach me?...
| (:sly)This is an FFCS broadcast, isn't it. Clever android.
| (:angry)Now isn't a good time. What do you want?
~ player
- This is important.
  ~ innis
  | (:angry)It'd better be. Get on with it then.
- Sorry to interrupt.
  ~ innis
  | (:angry)I'll accept that apology if you have something useful to say.
- How do you know about FFCS?
  ~ innis
  | (:sly)I wouldnae have been very good at my old job if I didnae ken it.
  | (:angry)Get on with it then.
~ player
| The power line to one of the cameras has been cut by hand.
~ innis
| (:angry)... Then we have a "saboteur"(orange). (:sly)Maybe a sly Cerebat spy, watching you right now.

|   | Go on.
| - They were "saboteurs". Plural.
|   ~ innis
|   | What do you mean?
| - Way ahead of you.
|   ~ innis
|   | Explain.
| ~ player
| | I came this way before and was attacked by a gang. I dispatched them.

; sense: Cerebats wouldn't typically take down CCTV (despite what Innis said in cctv-4 - it was logical though), nor employ Rogues... The Wraw would do both though. And nor would Rogues attack CCTV alone

~ innis
| (:sly)I'm glad you survived the saboteurs.
| (:normal)So what are we dealing with?
~ player
- It was a band of Rogues.
  ~ innis
  | ... Rogues? They're no' who the Cerebats would employ.
- Wannabe samurais and their pet dogs.
  ~ innis
  | Rogues then, with wolf packs. They're no' who the Cerebats would employ.
- Do the Cerebats have a K-9 unit?
  ~ innis
  | (:angry)...
  | (:normal)Rogues then, with wolf packs. They're no' who the Cerebats would employ.
~ innis
| They're no' the kind who would cross our border neither.
| ...
| (:angry)I think we've got a problem. A mutual problem:
| "The Wraw."(orange)
| There've been other signs lately that say "the Wraw have invaded the Cerebats"(orange). {#@islay-nametag} warned me about this.
| And it looks like "we might be next"(orange).
| Damn it.
| (:normal)I need to speak with my sister.
