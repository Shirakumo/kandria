~ islay
| Hello again. You found {#@alex-nametag}, I see. How are they?
~ player
- Drunk as a skunk.
- They won't cooperate.
- Angry.
~ islay
| (:nervous)... Sometimes I wonder why we make alcohol.
| (:normal)What if I talk to them?
~ player
- I'd appreciate that.
  ~ islay
  | It's the least I can do.
- What's the catch?
  ~ islay
  | No catch. I just want to help.
- I think they're a lost cause.
  ~ islay
  | Maybe. But were you yourself not a lost cause before {#@alex-nametag} found you?
~ islay
| You should stay with us a while, give me some time. That way you won't disappoint {#@fi-nametag} by returning empty-handed.
| And there are things you could help us with.
~ player
- So there is a catch.
  ~ islay
  | Not a catch. Think of it more like a trade.
  | And it couldn't hurt to show my sister what you can do, could it? Sow some seeds of diplomacy.
- Like you turning me into a battery?
  ~ islay
  | Of course not. I'm talking about errands.
  | And it couldn't hurt to show my sister what you can do, could it? Sow some seeds of diplomacy.
- What things?
  ~ islay
  | Well, it couldn't hurt to show my sister what you can do, could it? Sow some seeds of diplomacy.
- [(var 'android-soft) Won't {#@innis-nametag} think you've gone soft for androids?]
  ~ islay
  | ... Touch√©.
  | I'll deal with that. But it couldn't hurt to show her what you can do, could it? Sow some seeds of diplomacy.
~ player
- You're right.
  ~ islay
  | Aye, sometimes I'm right.
- Tell that to your sister.
  ~ islay
  | I do. Frequently. {#@innis-nametag} has her qualities. Diplomacy isn't one of them.
- Diplomacy does not compute.
  ~ islay
  | Come now, you're no mere Servo. I know you understand.
~ islay
| I can sweeten the deal too.
| I suppose I'm what you'd call the chief engineer around here. Just like {#@jack-nametag} is for the Noka. I stock many things that might be useful to you.
| We get the usual traders visiting of course, but I'm giving you another option - and "I stock more supplies than most"(orange).
| Anyhow, much as I'd hate to send you back into the jaws of my sister, she's got my report on our most urgent needs.
| We've got "rail engineers stuck"(orange) after a tunnel collapse in the "far high west"(orange).
| And "4 of our CCTV cameras on the distant low eastern"(orange) Cerebat border have gone down.
| Word's getting around about your arrival too - you might "find some of my sisters are also willing to pay for your skills"(orange).
| So "leave {#@alex-nametag} to me and speak with {#@innis-nametag}"(orange) - she's gone up to the "control room"(orange).
| Perhaps see her as another challenge to overcome. I know I do.
| Ta-ta for now, {(nametag player)}.
